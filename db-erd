Favorite (Relationship)
Note: Currently, the frontend implementation uses localStorage to store favorites locally on the client's device. However, strictly following the 
db.json
 structure implies a backend storage for favorites to sync across devices.

In a database context, this entity resolves the Many-to-Many relationship between Users and Anime.

user_id: Foreign key referencing a User.
anime_id: Foreign key referencing an Anime.
